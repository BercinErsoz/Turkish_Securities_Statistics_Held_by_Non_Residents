coupon rate, the coupon dates, and the currency of denomination and settlement.

long-term debt securities issued in Türkiye by the Ministry of Treasury and
Finance. Securities with a maturity of one year or longer are called Government
Bonds, and securities with a maturity of less than one year are called Treasury
Bills. GDDS can be issued in Turkish lira (TRY), foreign currency, or gold. The
GDDS definition also covers the lease certificates issued by the Ministry of

acquisition, as follows:
▪ Outright Purchase: Purchase of a security from the market at a specified price. In
this transaction, the purchaser is not obliged to sell back the security to the seller at
any time.
▪ Reverse Repo: A transaction that involves a purchase of a security with a
commitment to sell it back on a pre-specified date.
▪ Collateral: Acquisition of a security as a collateral for a transaction.


Net Transactions: This item shows the net amount of change in the reference period over

for the price and exchange rate effects.
